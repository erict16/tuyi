# Agent instructions

Before starting any task, read `docs/MEMORY.md` and every document in `docs/` relevant to the requested work. Treat these documents as durable project memory.

Preferred CLI is `python -m tuyi` (frozen names `tuyi` / `tuyi-cli`). User data lives under `~/.tuyi_*`. Older config filenames listed as `PREVIOUS_*` in `backend/app_meta.py` migrate once; do not write new files under those names.

Before handing off every task, record its completed work, current state, and any changed decision in `docs/MEMORY.md`. Update the relevant document in `docs/` when the task changes a project decision, workflow, version, packaging rule, or acceptance criterion.
